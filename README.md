Here is presented the step-by-step implementation of the k-means algorithm based on example from Roger D. Peng's book [Exploratory Data Analysis with R](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/k-means-clustering.html).
In try_k-means.Rmd you can try to use your dataset.   

**UPD1.** For now on you can find out how k-means work by using [shiny app](https://dmytroin.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/) :)!!
